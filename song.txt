Your words up on thе wall as you'rе prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the namеs that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic!
 
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself..!)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Yeah)
(Look out for yourself..!)
Uh, look, okay
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin'
They wanted static with precision
I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sacking, pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we is just--
 
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
 
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a Saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a Saint
(Look out for yourself..!)
